<h1>Three.js Car Scene</h1>

This project creates a basic 3D scene using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) to render a simple car model that spins continuously. It includes lighting, camera setup, and custom textures for the car's front and sides.

<h2>Features</h2>

- Orthographic camera for a flat, 2D-like view.
- Ambient and directional lighting for better scene visibility.
- Custom car model with front and side textures.
- Responsive rendering: the scene adjusts to the window size dynamically.
- Continuous car rotation for animation.
